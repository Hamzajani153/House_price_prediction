# House_price_prediction

The project "House Price Prediction using Flask" involves deploying a machine learning model 
for predicting house prices through a web application built with Flask. The project utilizes 
Python for developing the machine learning model and backend logic, while Flask serves as the 
web framework to create the application and API for interacting with the model. The 
development process includes data preparation, model training, Flask integration, frontend 
design, and deployment on a server to make the application accessible online.
This project showcases the practical application of machine learning in predicting house 
prices and demonstrates how Flask can be effectively used to deploy predictive models through 
user-friendly web applications.
